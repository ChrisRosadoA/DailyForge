This Discord bot is designed to help users track their daily goals and tasks in a fun and interactive way, while rewarding them with XP points for task completion. Users can set goals for a specified duration (e.g., 1 month), and the bot will remind them daily to check in and mark tasks as completed.

## Key Features:
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set daily tasks/goals with a specified duration (e.g., a month).
- **Daily Reminders**: The bot sends daily reminders to encourage users to check in and complete their tasks.

- **Leveling System**: The bot features a leveling system, rewarding users for consistent task completion.

## How It Works:
1. Users set goals using the `!set_goals` command and specify the duration.
2. The bot reminds them daily to check in and mark tasks as complete.
3. XP is rewarded for each completed task, and the user's level increases as they accumulate more XP.
